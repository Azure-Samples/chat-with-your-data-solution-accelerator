# Local setup

> **Note for macOS Developers**: If you are using macOS on Apple Silicon (ARM64) the DevContainer will **not** work. This is due to a limitation with the Azure Functions Core Tools (see [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/issues/3112)). We recommend using the [Non DevContainer Setup](./NON_DEVCONTAINER_SETUP.md) instructions to run the accelerator locally.

The easiest way to run this accelerator is in a VS Code Dev Containers, which will open the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
1. Open the project:
    [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/azure-samples/chat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator)
1. In the VS Code window that opens, once the project files show up (this may take several minutes), open a terminal window
1. Run `azd auth login`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_APP_SERVICE_HOSTING_MODEL code` - This sets your environment to deploy code rather than rely on public containers, like the "Deploy to Azure" button.
1. To use an existing Log Analytics workspace, follow the [setup steps here](../docs/re-use-log-analytics.md) before running `azd up`.
1. To use an existing Resource Group, follow the [setup steps here](../docs/re-use-resource-group.md) before running `azd up`.
1. Run `azd up` - This will provision Azure resources and deploy the accelerator to those resources.

    * **Important**: Beware that the resources created by this command will incur immediate costs, primarily from the AI Search resource. These resources may accrue costs even if you interrupt the command before it is fully executed. You can run `azd down` or delete the resources manually to avoid unnecessary spending.
    * You will be prompted to select a subscription, and a location. That location list is based on the [OpenAI model availability table](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability) and may become outdated as availability changes.
    * If you do, accidentally, chose the wrong location; you will have to ensure that you use `azd down` or delete the Resource Group as the deployment bases the location from this Resource Group.
1. After the application has been successfully deployed you will see a URL printed to the console.  Click that URL to interact with the application in your browser.

> NOTE: It may take up to an hour for the application to be fully deployed. If you see a "Python Developer" welcome screen or an error page, then wait a bit and refresh the page.

> NOTE: The default auth type uses keys that are stored in the Azure Keyvault. If you want to use RBAC-based auth (more secure), please run before deploying:

```bash
azd env set AZURE_AUTH_TYPE rbac
azd env set USE_KEY_VAULT false
```

Also please refer to the section on [setting up RBAC auth](#authenticate-using-rbac).

## Deployment Options & Steps

### Sandbox or WAF Aligned Deployment Options

The [`infra`](../infra) folder of the Chat With Your Data Solution Accelerator contains the [`main.bicep`](../infra/main.bicep) Bicep script, which defines all Azure infrastructure components for this solution.

By default, the `azd up` command uses the [`main.parameters.json`](../infra/main.parameters.json) file to deploy the solution. This file is pre-configured for a **sandbox environment** â€” ideal for development and proof-of-concept scenarios, with minimal security and cost controls for rapid iteration.

For **production deployments**, the repository also provides [`main.waf.parameters.json`](../infra/main.waf.parameters.json), which applies a [Well-Architected Framework (WAF) aligned](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/) configuration. This option enables additional Azure best practices for reliability, security, cost optimization, operational excellence, and performance efficiency, such as:

  - Enhanced network security (e.g., Network protection with private endpoints)
  - Stricter access controls and managed identities
  - Logging, monitoring, and diagnostics enabled by default
  - Resource tagging and cost management recommendations

**How to choose your deployment configuration:**

* Use the default `main.parameters.json` file for a **sandbox/dev environment**
* For a **WAF-aligned, production-ready deployment**, copy the contents of `main.waf.parameters.json` into `main.parameters.json` before running `azd up`

---

### VM Credentials Configuration

By default, the solution sets the VM administrator username and password from environment variables.

To set your own VM credentials before deployment, use:

```sh
azd env set AZURE_ENV_VM_ADMIN_USERNAME <your-username>
azd env set AZURE_ENV_VM_ADMIN_PASSWORD <your-password>
```

> [!TIP]
> Always review and adjust parameter values (such as region, capacity, security settings and log analytics workspace configuration) to match your organization's requirements before deploying. For production, ensure you have sufficient quota and follow the principle of least privilege for all identities and role assignments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The WAF-aligned configuration is under active development. More Azure Well-Architected recommendations will be added in future updates.

## Detailed Development Container setup instructions

The solution contains a [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) with all the required tooling to develop and deploy the accelerator. To deploy the Chat With Your Data accelerator using the provided development container you will also need:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Remote containers extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

If you are running this on Windows, we recommend you clone this repository in [WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/chat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator
```

Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code and connect to the development container.

```cmd
code .
```

!!! tip
    Visual Studio Code should recognize the available development container and ask you to open the folder using it. For additional details on connecting to remote containers, please see the [Open an existing folder in a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container) quickstart.

When you start the development container for the first time, the container will be built. This usually takes a few minutes. **Please use the development container for all further steps.**

The files for the dev container are located in `/.devcontainer/` folder.

## Local debugging

To customize the accelerator or run it locally, you must provision the Azure resources by running `azd provision` in a Terminal. This will generate a `.env` for you and you can use the "Run and Debug" (Ctrl + Shift + D) command to chose which part of the accelerator to run.  There is an [environment variable values table](#environment-variables) below.


To run the accelerator in local when the solution is secured by RBAC you need to assign some roles to your principal id. You can do it either manually or programatically.

### Manually assign roles
You need to assign the following roles to your `PRINCIPALID` (you can get your 'principal id' from Microsoft Entra ID):

| Role | GUID |
|----|----|
| Cognitive Services OpenAI User | 5e0bd9bd-7b93-4f28-af87-19fc36ad61bd |
| Cognitive Services User | a97b65f3-24c7-4388-baec-2e87135dc908 |
| Cosmos DB SQL Data Contributor | 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 ([How to assign](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-rbac#role-assignments)) |
| Key Vault Secrets User | 4633458b-17de-408a-b874-0445c86b69e6 |
| Search Index Data Contributor | 8ebe5a00-799e-43f5-93ac-243d3dce84a7 |
| Search Service Contributor | 7ca78c08-252a-4471-8644-bb5ff32d4ba0 |
| Storage Blob Data Contributor | ba92f5b4-2d11-453d-a403-e96b0029c9fe |
| Storage Queue Data Contributor | 974c5e8b-45b9-4653-ba55-5f855dd0fb88 |

### Programatically assign roles
You can also update the `principalId` value with your own principalId in the `main.bicep` file.

### Authenticate using RBAC
To authenticate using API Keys, update the value of `AZURE_AUTH_TYPE` to keys. For accessing using 'rbac', manually make changes by following the below steps:
1. Ensure role assignments listed on [this page](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/eliminate-dependency-on-key-based-authentication-in-azure/ba-p/3821880)
have been created.
2. Navigate to your Search service in the Azure Portal
3. Under Settings, select `Keys`
4. Select either `Role-based access control` or `Both`
5. Navigate to your App service in the Azure Portal
6. Under Settings, select `Configuration`
7. Set the value of the `AZURE_AUTH_TYPE` setting to `rbac`
8. Restart the application

### Deploy services manually

You can deploy the full solution from local with the following command `azd deploy`. You can also deploy services individually

|Service  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`azd deploy web` | A python app, enabling you to chat on top of your data.         |
|`azd deploy adminweb`     | A Streamlit app for the "admin" site where you can upload and explore your data.         |
|`azd deploy function`     | A python function app processing requests.          |

### Running All Services Locally Using Docker Compose

To run all applications using Docker Compose, you first need a `.env` file containing the configuration for your
provisioned resources. This file can be created manually at the root of the project. Alternatively, if resources were
provisioned using `azd provision` or `azd up`, a `.env` file is automatically generated in the `.azure/<env-name>/.env`
file. To get your `<env-name>` run `azd env list` to see which env is default.

Set APP_ENV in your `.env` file to control Azure authentication. Set the environment variable to dev to use Azure CLI credentials, or to prod to use Managed Identity for production. Ensure you're logged in via az login when using dev in local. To configure your environment, ensure that APP_ENV is set to **"dev"** in your .env file.

The `AzureWebJobsStorage` needs to be added to your `.env` file manually. This can be retrieved from the function
settings via the Azure Portal.

To start the services, you can use either of the following commands:
- `make docker-compose-up`
- `cd docker && AZD_ENV_FILE=<path-to-env-file> docker-compose up`

**Note:** By default, these commands will run the latest Docker images built from the main branch. If you wish to use a
different image, you will need to modify the `docker/docker-compose.yml` file accordingly.

### Develop & run the frontend locally

For faster development, you can run the frontend Typescript React UI app and the Python Flask api app in development mode. This allows the app to "hot reload" meaning your changes will automatically be reflected in the app without having to refresh or restart the local servers.

They can be launched locally from vscode (Ctrl+Shift+D) and selecting "Launch Frontend (api)" and "Launch Frontend (UI). You will also be able to place breakpoints in the code should you wish. This will automatically install any dependencies for Node and Python.


#### Starting the Flask app in dev mode from the command line (optional)
This step is included if you cannot use the Launch configuration in VSCode. Open a terminal and enter the following commands
```shell
cd code
poetry run flask run
```

#### Starting the Typescript React app in dev mode (optional)
This step is included if you cannot use the Launch configuration in VSCode. Open a new separate terminal and enter the following commands:
```shell
cd code\frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The local vite server will return a url that you can use to access the chat interface locally, such as  `http://localhost:5174/`.

### Develop & run the admin app

The admin app can be launched locally from vscode (Ctrl+Shift+D) and selecting "Launch Admin site". You will also be able to place breakpoints in the Python Code should you wish.

This should automatically open `http://localhost:8501/` and render the admin interface.

### Develop & run the batch processing functions

If you want to develop and run the batch processing functions container locally, use the following commands.

#### Running the batch processing locally

First, install [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Cportal%2Cv2%2Cbash&pivots=programming-language-python).

```shell
cd code\backend\batch
poetry run func start
```

Or use the [Azure Functions VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions).

#### Debugging the batch processing functions locally
Rename the file `local.settings.json.sample` in the `batch` folder to `local.settings.json` and update the `AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName` value with the storage account name.

Copy the .env file from [previous section](#local-debugging) to the `batch` folder.

Execute the above [shell command](#L81) to run the function locally. You may need to stop the deployed function on the portal so that all requests are debugged locally. To trigger the function, you can click on the corresponding URL that will be printed to the terminal.

```sh
az deployment sub create --template-file ./infra/main.bicep --subscription {your_azure_subscription_id} --location {search_location}
 ```
