[Back to *Chat with your data* README](../README.md)

## Development Container

The solution contains a [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) with all the required tooling to develop and deploy the accelerator. To deploy the Chat With Your Data accelerator using the provided development container you will also need:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Remote containers extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

If you are running this on Windows, we recommend you clone this repository in [WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/chat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator
```

Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code and connect to the development container.

```cmd
code .
```

!!! tip
    Visual Studio Code should recognize the available development container and ask you to open the folder using it. For additional details on connecting to remote containers, please see the [Open an existing folder in a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container) quickstart.

When you start the development container for the first time, the container will be built. This usually takes a few minutes. **Please use the development container for all further steps.**

The files for the dev container are located in `/.devcontainer/` folder.

## Local deployment

To customize the accelerator or run it locally, first, copy the `.env.sample` file to your development environment's `.env` file, and edit it according to [environment variable values table](#environment-variables) below.


To run the accelerator in local you need to assign some roles to your principal id. You can do it either manually or programatically.

### Manually assign roles
You need to assign the following roles to your `PRINCIPALID` (you can get your 'principal id' from Microsoft Entra ID):
| Role | GUID |
|----|----|
|  Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor | a001fd3d-188f-4b5d-821b-7da978bf7442 |
| Search Service Contributor | 7ca78c08-252a-4471-8644-bb5ff32d4ba0 |
| Search Index Data Contributor | 8ebe5a00-799e-43f5-93ac-243d3dce84a7 |
| Storage Blob Data Reader | 2a2b9908-6ea1-4ae2-8e65-a410df84e7d1 |
| Reader | acdd72a7-3385-48ef-bd42-f606fba81ae7 |

### Programatically assign roles
You can also update the `principalId` value with your own principalId in `deployment.bicep` file.

Then deploy the bicep file using the below command:
```shell
az deployment group create --resource-group {your_resource_group} --template-file deployment.bicep --subscription {your_azure_subscription_id}
```

### Authenticate using RBAC
To authenticate using API Keys, update the value of `AZURE_AUTH_TYPE` to keys. For accessing using 'rbac', manually make changes by following the below steps:
1. Ensure role assignments listed on [this page](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/eliminate-dependency-on-key-based-authentication-in-azure/ba-p/3821880) 
have been created.
2. Navigate to your Search service in the Azure Portal
3. Under Settings, select `Keys`
4. Select either `Role-based access control` or `Both`
5. Navigate to your App service in the Azure Portal
6. Under Settings, select `Configuration`
7. Set the value of the `AZURE_AUTH_TYPE` setting to `rbac`
8. Restart the application

### Running the full solution locally with Docker Compose

You can run the full solution locally with the following commands - this will spin up 3 different Docker containers:

|Container  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|webapp | A container for the chat app, enabling you to chat on top of your data.         |
|admin webapp     | A container for the "admin" site where you can upload and explore your data.         |
|batch processing functions     | A container helping with processing requests.          |

Run the following `docker compose` command.

```shell
cd docker
docker compose up
```

### Develop & run the frontend locally

For faster development, you can run the frontend Typescript React UI app and the Python Flask api app in development mode. This allows the app to "hot reload" meaning your changes will automatically be reflected in the app without having to refresh or restart the local servers.

They can be launched locally from vscode (Ctrl+Shift+D) and selecting "Launch Frontend (api)" and "Launch Frontend (UI). You will also be able to place breakpoints in the code should you wish. This will automatically install any dependencies for Node and Python.

#### Starting the Flask app in dev mode from the command line (optional)
This step is included if you cannot use the Launch configuration in VSCode. Open a terminal and enter the following commands
```shell
cd code
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cd app
python -m flask --app ./app.py --debug run
```

#### Starting the Typescript React app in dev mode (optional)
This step is included if you cannot use the Launch configuration in VSCode. Open a new separate terminal and enter the following commands:
```shell
cd code\app\frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The local vite server will return a url that you can use to access the chat interface locally, such as  `http://localhost:5174/`.

#### Building the user app Docker image

```shell
docker build -f docker\WebApp.Dockerfile -t YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:80 YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
docker push YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
```

### Develop & run the admin app

The admin app can be launched locally from vscode (Ctrl+Shift+D) and selecting "Launch Admin site". You will also be able to place breakpoints in the Python Code should you wish.

This should automatically open `http://localhost:8501/` and render the admin interface.

#### Building the backend Docker image

```shell
docker build -f docker\AdminWebApp.Dockerfile -t YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8081:80 YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
docker push YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
```

**NOTE**: If you are using Linux, make sure to go to https://github.com/Azure-Samples/chat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml#L9 and modify the docker-compose.yml to use forward slash /. The backslash version just works with Windows.


### Develop & run the batch processing functions

If you want to develop and run the batch processing functions container locally, use the following commands.

#### Running the batch processing locally

First, install [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Cportal%2Cv2%2Cbash&pivots=programming-language-python).

```shell
cd code\batch
func start
```

Or use the [Azure Functions VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions).

#### Debugging the batch processing functions locally
Rename the file `local.settings.json.sample` in the `batch` folder to `local.settings.json` and update the `AzureWebJobsStorage` value with the storage account connection string.

Execute the above [shell command](#L81) to run the function locally. You may need to stop the deployed function on the portal so that all requests are debugged locally.

#### Building the batch processing Docker image

```shell
docker build -f docker\Backend.Dockerfile -t YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE .
docker run --env-file .env -p 7071:80 YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
docker push YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
```
