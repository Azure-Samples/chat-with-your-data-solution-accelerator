## User story
Welcome to the *Chat with your data* Solution accelerator repository! The *Chat with your data* Solution accelerator is a powerful tool that combines the capabilities of Azure AI Search and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a conversational search experience. This solution accelerator uses an Azure OpenAI GPT model and an Azure AI Search index generated from your data, which is integrated into a web application to provide a natural language interface, including [speech-to-text](docs/speech_to_text.md) functionality, for search queries. Users can drag and drop files, point to storage, and take care of technical setup to transform documents. Everything can be deployed in your own subscription to accelerate your use of this technology.

### About this repo

This repository provides an end-to-end solution for users who want to query their data with natural language. It includes a well designed ingestion mechanism for multiple file types, an easy deployment, and a support team for maintenance. The accelerator demonstrates both Push or Pull Ingestion; the choice of orchestration (Semantic Kernel or LangChain) and should be the minimum components needed to implement a RAG pattern. It is not intended to be put into Production as-is without experimentation or evaluation of your data. It provides the following features:

* Chat with an Azure OpenAI model using your own data
* Upload and process your documents
* Index public web pages
* Easy prompt configuration
* Multiple chunking strategies

### When should you use this repo?

If you need to customize your scenario beyond what [Azure OpenAI on your data](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/use-your-data) offers out-of-the-box, use this repository.
By default, this repo comes with one specific set of RAG configurations including but not limited to: chunk size, overlap, retrieval/search type and system prompt. It is important that you evaluate the retrieval/search and the generation of the answers for your data and tune these configurations accordingly before you use this repo in production. For a starting point to understand and perform RAG evaluations, we encourage you to look into the [RAG Experiment Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/rag-experiment-accelerator).

The accelerator presented here provides several options, for example:
* The ability to ground a model using both data and public web pages
* A backend with support for 'custom' and 'On Your Data' [conversation flows](./docs/conversation_flow_options.md)
* Advanced prompt engineering capabilities
* An admin site for ingesting/inspecting/configuring your dataset on the fly
* Push or Pull model for data ingestion:  See [integrated vectorization](./docs/integrated_vectorization.md) documentation for more details
* Running a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution locally

*Have you seen [ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and AI Search demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo)? If you would like to experiment: Play with prompts, understanding RAG pattern different implementation approaches, see how different features interact with the RAG pattern and choose the best options for your RAG deployments, take a look at that repo.

Here is a comparison table with a few features offered by Azure, an available GitHub demo sample and this repo, that can provide guidance when you need to decide which one to use:
