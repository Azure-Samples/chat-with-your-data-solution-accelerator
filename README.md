# "Chat with your data" Solution Accelerator  
  
Welcome to the "Chat with your data" Solution Accelerator repository! 

The "Chat with your data" Solution Accelerator is a powerful tool that combines the capabilities of Azure Cognitive Search and GPT language model to create a conversational search experience. The solution accelerator includes ChatGPT model and a search index generated from your data, which can be integrated into a web application to provide users with a natural language interface for search queries.

This repository provides a template for setting up the solution accelerator, along with detailed instructions on how to use and customize it to fit your specific needs.


## When should you use this repo? 

*If you are looking to implement the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pattern and chat with your enterprise data, Microsoft built-in and recommended product for this is here: [Azure OpenAI Service on your data][../azure/cognitive-services/openai/use-your-data-quickstart]. If there is any functionality that you require that is still not available in the product, follow up with [Azure OpenAI Service on your data contact](emailto:wedne_support@microsoft.com) for feedback and to understand your business need.*

In case your setup requires more customization than what is currently available out-of-the-box with [Azure OpenAI Service on your data][../azure/cognitive-services/openai/use-your-data-quickstart], this is the repo for you!

*Have you seen [ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo)? If you would like to play with prompts, understanding RAG pattern different implementation approaches and similar demo tasks, that is your repo!*

If you would like to create a POC [Proof of Concept] and customize to your own business needs and understand best practices, this is the repo for you!

## Upcoming Release Schedule and Internal Feedback Guidelines (TO BE REMOVED BEFORE GOING PUBLIC)

We are excited to announce that the initial version of our project will be released during the week of July 10th for early reviews and feedback. This release will include a minimal amount of documentation focusing on deployment. The majority of the documentation will be created, added, and reviewed between July 10th and July 21st, along with any code improvements, before our initial public release.

To provide feedback internally, please follow these guidelines:

a) **Report errors using GitHub Issues:** If you encounter any errors, please log an issue in the repository at [Issues · Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-solution-accelerator (github.com)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-solution-accelerator/issues).

b) **Submit recommendations for documentation/code via Pull Requests**: If you have suggestions for improvements in documentation or code (once tested), please submit a pull request (PR) at [Pull requests · Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-solution-accelerator (github.com](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-solution-accelerator/pulls)). Note that new functionality PRs involving other products not included in Version 1 will not be considered for the initial public release but will be triaged for future updates. We will review and approve PRs related to the current deployment if they enhance customer understanding, follow best practices, or help fix identified errors.

c) **Provide feedback on other topics in the Feedback Channel**: For any other feedback, please create a post in the ["Chat with your data" Solution Accelerator Feedback Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3acee78935c39448e1a53474e88464e68e%40thread.tacv2/Feedback?groupId=845e2cfa-3fff-4488-affe-1d9c616545b7&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) for discussion.

d) **Consider creating a forked repository for specific use cases**: This project serves as a general, robust sample for Proof of Concepts (POCs) of the RAG implementation, including best practices and recommendations. It is designed to be easy for customers to understand, deploy, modify, and adapt. If you have suggestions for additional functionality that may not be applicable to most deployments, we recommend discussing whether it would be more appropriate to create a forked repository tailored to specific industries or use cases.

By following these guidelines, you help us improve the project and ensure its success. We appreciate your feedback and collaboration!
