This involves filing claims with both plans and providing necessary documentation like the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) [doc3].\n\n4. **Coverage Limitations**: The Northwind Standard plan does not cover certain services, including emergency care, mental health and substance abuse treatment, or out-of-network services. You should explore alternative coverage options if you need these services [doc4][doc5].\n\n5. **Preventive Care and Prescription Drugs**: The plan covers preventive care services and prescription drugs, which you should take advantage of to maximize your benefits [doc6][doc7].\n\n6. **Emergency Services**: Emergency services are covered, but the costs can vary depending on whether the services are received in-network or out-of-network.

This means that, if you choose to visit a provider who is not in-network, you will have to pay the entire cost of the service out-of-pocket. <h2>Exceptions</h2>\n<p>There are some exceptions to this rule. If you are traveling outside of the United States and you cannot find an in-network provider, you may be able to visit a non-participating provider and Northwind Health Plus may cover a portion of the cost.

When you use in-network providers, you'll pay lower out-of-pocket costs. On the other hand, if you use out-of-network providers, you'll be responsible for a larger portion of the cost.

One of the most significant components that affects your costs is the provider you choose. Northwind Standard provides coverage for a variety of in-network <p>providers, and the costs associated with each provider can vary significantly. To ensure you're getting the best value for your health care services, it's important to understand how providers can affect your costs.</p>\n<h2>In-Network Providers</h2>\n<p>Choosing in-network providers is the most cost-effective option when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan. In-network providers have agreed to accept a discounted rate on services, which means they are often less expensive than out-of-network providers. When selecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for services, often referred to as a \"co-pay\" or \"co-insurance\". It's important to note that different types of services may require different co-pays or co-insurance, so it's best to contact your provider to understand what the cost will be.</p>\n<h2>Out-of-Network Providers</h2>\n<p>Northwind Standard offers coverage for some out-of-network providers, but the costs associated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in-network providers. If you choose an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire cost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in-network provider. In some cases, Northwind Standard may offer coverage for out-of-network providers, but you may still have to pay more than you would for an in-network provider.</p>\n<h2>Exceptions</h2>\n<p>Some providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan coverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for services that are not covered. Additionally, it's important to note that there may be different rules and coverage levels associated with certain types of services, such as those related to mental health and substance abuse.</p>\n<p>Tips</p>\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details: [/documents/Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf](https://strzu4ccxi6fm2eu.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf?se=2030-05-18T12%3A07%3A21Z&sp=r&sv=2024-05-04&sr=c&skoid=e90f1238-6e3e-4a31-9447-6aa810afc687&sktid=52b39610-0746-4c25-a83d-d4f89fadedfe&skt=2025-05-19T12%3A07%3A21Z&ske=2025-05-20T12%3A07%3A21Z&sks=b&skv=2024-05-04&sig=gr5uCjfge2/xS8SyFD3SDnzOAFqz86wtA/vGUuzkBZM%3D)\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 Make sure to take advantage of preventive care services. These services are covered 100% by the plan and can help you avoid more costly treatments down the line.</p>\n<p>\u00b7 Always make sure to visit in-network providers. Doing so will ensure that you receive the maximum benefit from your plan.</p>\n<p>\u00b7 Consider generic prescription drugs when available. These drugs can often be cheaper than brand-name drugs and are just as effective.</p>\n<p>\u00b7 Talk to your doctor about ways to save money. Many doctors are willing to work with you to find the most cost-effective treatment options available.</p>\n<p>\u00b7 Review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statements carefully. This document will show you exactly how much you are being charged for each service and what your plan is covering.</p>\n<p>By following these tips, you can ensure that you are getting the most out of your Northwind Standard health plan.</p>\n<h2>HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS</h2>\n<p>In-Network Providers HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS</p>\n<p>When selecting a health insurance plan, one of the most important factors to consider is the network of in-network providers that are available with the plan.</p>\n<p>Northwind Standard offers a wide variety of in-network providers, ranging from primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This allows you to choose a provider that is convenient for you and your family, while also helping you to keep your costs low.</p>\n<p>When you choose a provider that is in-network with your plan, you will typically pay lower copays and deductibles than you would with an out-of-network provider. In addition, many services, such as preventive care, may be covered at no cost when you receive care from an in-network provider.</p>\n<p>It is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network <p>services.

One of the most significant components that affects your costs is the provider you choose. Northwind Standard provides coverage for a variety of in-network <p>providers, and the costs associated with each provider can vary significantly. To ensure you're getting the best value for your health care services, it's important to understand how providers can affect your costs.</p>\n<h2>In-Network Providers</h2>\n<p>Choosing in-network providers is the most cost-effective option when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan. In-network providers have agreed to accept a discounted rate on services, which means they are often less expensive than out-of-network providers. When selecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for services, often referred to as a \"co-pay\" or \"co-insurance\". It's important to note that different types of services may require different co-pays or co-insurance, so it's best to contact your provider to understand what the cost will be.</p>\n<h2>Out-of-Network Providers</h2>\n<p>Northwind Standard offers coverage for some out-of-network providers, but the costs associated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in-network providers. If you choose an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire cost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in-network provider. In some cases, Northwind Standard may offer coverage for out-of-network providers, but you may still have to pay more than you would for an in-network provider.</p>\n<h2>Exceptions</h2>\n<p>Some providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan coverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for services that are not covered. Additionally, it's important to note that there may be different rules and coverage levels associated with certain types of services, such as those related to mental health and substance abuse.</p>\n<p>Tips</p>\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details: [/documents/Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf](https://strzu4ccxi6fm2eu.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf?se=2030-05-18T12%3A07%3A30Z&sp=r&sv=2024-05-04&sr=c&skoid=e90f1238-6e3e-4a31-9447-6aa810afc687&sktid=52b39610-0746-4c25-a83d-d4f89fadedfe&skt=2025-05-19T12%3A07%3A30Z&ske=2025-05-20T12%3A07%3A30Z&sks=b&skv=2024-05-04&sig=CdJHvu6l%2BXb5zutTD9Cl6LkvxZqsuh5fEWpZHz7HZaA%3D)\n\n\n<p>.

One of the most significant components that affects your costs is the provider you choose. Northwind Standard provides coverage for a variety of in-network <p>providers, and the costs associated with each provider can vary significantly. To ensure you're getting the best value for your health care services, it's important to understand how providers can affect your costs.</p>\n<h2>In-Network Providers</h2>\n<p>Choosing in-network providers is the most cost-effective option when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan. In-network providers have agreed to accept a discounted rate on services, which means they are often less expensive than out-of-network providers. When selecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for services, often referred to as a \"co-pay\" or \"co-insurance\". It's important to note that different types of services may require different co-pays or co-insurance, so it's best to contact your provider to understand what the cost will be.</p>\n<h2>Out-of-Network Providers</h2>\n<p>Northwind Standard offers coverage for some out-of-network providers, but the costs associated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in-network providers. If you choose an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire cost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in-network provider. In some cases, Northwind Standard may offer coverage for out-of-network providers, but you may still have to pay more than you would for an in-network provider.</p>\n<h2>Exceptions</h2>\n<p>Some providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan coverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for services that are not covered. Additionally, it's important to note that there may be different rules and coverage levels associated with certain types of services, such as those related to mental health and substance abuse.</p>\n<p>Tips</p>", "latency": 10.425959, "response_length": 1187}
{"query": "Can I still receive coverage if I choose an out-of-network provider?", "ground_truth": "Yes, you can still receive coverage if you choose an out-of-network provider, but there are important considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Higher Costs**: You will generally be responsible for a greater portion of the costs when using out-of-network providers compared to in-network providers. Out-of-network providers have not contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate, so they are not required to accept the payment amount offered by Northwind Health, leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses for you [doc1][doc2].\n\n2. **Exceptions**: There are some exceptions where Northwind Health Plus may cover a portion of the costs for out-of-network providers. For example, if you are traveling outside of the United States and cannot find an in-network provider, or if you are in a life-threatening situation and need to go to the nearest hospital, Northwind Health Plus may provide coverage for the care received [doc3][doc4].\n\n3. **Balance Billing**: You may be subject to balance billing, which occurs when the out-of-network provider bills you for the difference between their charges and the amount paid by Northwind Health Plus [doc5].\n\n4. **Cost Sharing**: Services received from out-of-network providers may not count towards your deductible or be applied to your out-of-pocket maximum, meaning you could be responsible for the entire cost of the services minus any applicable discounts [doc6].\n\n5. **Research and Questions**: It is important to do your research and ask questions about the provider's billing policies, cost of services, and any potential discounts. Contact Northwind Health Plus prior to receiving care to ensure the services are covered and to understand your financial responsibility [doc7].\n\nBy understanding these factors, you can make an informed decision about whether to seek care from an out-of-network provider.", "context": "Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details: [/documents/Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf](https://strzu4ccxi6fm2eu.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf?se=2030-05-18T12%3A07%3A40Z&sp=r&sv=2024-05-04&sr=c&skoid=e90f1238-6e3e-4a31-9447-6aa810afc687&sktid=52b39610-0746-4c25-a83d-d4f89fadedfe&skt=2025-05-19T12%3A07%3A40Z&ske=2025-05-20T12%3A07%3A40Z&sks=b&skv=2024-05-04&sig=l3xTZKb/dj6%2BhVX/xC0yPW2J/cC80rp3ag846YCqAaM%3D)\n\n\n<p>Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs.

Equity investments were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. </p>\n<p>Valuation </p>\n<p>In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs.

Their knowledgeable customer service representatives are always available to answer your questions and provide guidance on how best to use your coverage.</p>\n<h2>COB's Effect On Benefits WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?</h2>\n<p>When you have other health insurance coverage, coordination of benefits (COB) can affect how your benefits are paid. COB is a process where your insurance companies coordinate who pays first when you have multiple health insurance plans that cover the same medical expenses. The insurance company that pays first is called the primary payer, and the company that pays second is called the secondary payer.</p>\n<h2>Coordination of Benefits Exceptions</h2>\n<p>There are a few exceptions to COB rules that may apply to you. If you are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or a veterans' health plan, Northwind Standard may pay first, even if the other plan is usually the primary payer. Additionally, if you are enrolled in a plan that is required by law to coordinate benefits, such as an employer-sponsored plan, Northwind Standard may pay first.</p>\n<h2>Understanding How COB Affects Your Benefits</h2>\n<p>When COB applies, the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible expenses and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost. Depending on the type of service, the primary payer may pay all of the eligible expenses. When this happens, the secondary payer may pay nothing. <p>For example, if you receive a medical bill for $1,000 and the primary payer pays $800, the secondary payer will pay the remaining balance of $200. However, if the primary payer pays the full $1,000, the secondary payer will not pay anything.</p>\n<h2>Tips for Working with COB</h2>\n<p>When you have multiple health insurance plans, it's important to understand how COB works and how it can affect your benefits. Here are a few tips to help you manage your benefits:</p>\n<p>\u00b7 Make sure that each insurance company has all of the necessary information about your other coverage, including plan numbers and policy dates.</p>\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details: [/documents/Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf](https://strzu4ccxi6fm2eu.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf?se=2030-05-18T12%3A09%3A16Z&sp=r&sv=2024-05-04&sr=c&skoid=e90f1238-6e3e-4a31-9447-6aa810afc687&sktid=52b39610-0746-4c25-a83d-d4f89fadedfe&skt=2025-05-19T12%3A09%3A16Z&ske=2025-05-20T12%3A09%3A16Z&sks=b&skv=2024-05-04&sig=wPKS4NPXTGQ%2BRy8qg9XqVMVebqckhUCkCu279zy7ZRw%3D)\n\n\n<h2>Right to Benefits</h2>\n<p>You have the right to receive the benefits available under the Northwind Standard plan.

{"query": "Describe in more detail the risk from market volitality", "ground_truth": "The company is exposed to several types of market risks, including foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. These risks can impact the company's consolidated financial statements despite the use of derivative instruments to manage them.\n\n1. **Foreign Currency Risk**: Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company monitors its foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of its foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedging instruments. Additionally, foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and other foreign currency exposures [doc1][doc2][doc3][doc4][doc5].\n\n2. **Interest Rate Risk**: Securities held in the company's fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. The company manages the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices. Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. Option, futures, and swap contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, are also used to manage these risks [doc6][doc7][doc8][doc9][doc10].\n\n3. **Credit Risk**: The company's fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. Credit exposures are managed relative to broad-based indices to facilitate portfolio diversification. Credit default swap contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, are used to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices [doc11][doc12][doc13][doc14][doc15].\n\n4. **Equity Price Risk**: Securities held in the company's equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, the company may hold options, futures, and swap contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to manage this risk [doc16][doc17][doc18][doc19][doc20].\n\nThe company conducts sensitivity analysis to assess the potential loss in future earnings or fair values, including associated derivatives, resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates or prices [doc21][doc22][doc23].", "context": "MSFT_FY23Q4_10K (1): [/documents/MSFT_FY23Q4_10K (1).docx](https://strobi3t36om4a4a.blob.core.windows.net/documents/MSFT_FY23Q4_10K%20%281%29.docx?se=2030-05-18T12%3A10%3A52Z&sp=r&sv=2024-05-04&sr=c&skoid=e90f1238-6e3e-4a31-9447-6aa810afc687&sktid=52b39610-0746-4c25-a83d-d4f89fadedfe&skt=2025-05-19T12%3A10%3A52Z&ske=2025-05-20T12%3A10%3A52Z&sks=b&skv=2024-05-04&sig=lxSrrH8rgY7xUElXrYbCViKTztX6CI6mazsLyyH4xPM%3D)\n\n\n<p>ITEM\u00a07A.\u00a0QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</p>\n<p>RISKS </p>\n<p>We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices.
