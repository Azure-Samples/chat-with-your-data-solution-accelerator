# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Architectural decisions for CWYD v2. Each ADR captures a single decision, the context that forced it, and the consequences. Format: [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)-lite.

**Conventions**

- Filename: `NNNN-kebab-title.md` (4-digit, zero-padded, monotonic).
- One decision per ADR. If a follow-up changes the decision, write a new ADR that **supersedes** the old one — never edit a Status:Accepted ADR in place.
- Status values: `Proposed` · `Accepted` · `Superseded by ADR-NNNN` · `Deprecated`.
- ADRs are **read-only history** once Accepted. They are not the place to track work — that lives in [`development_plan.md`](../development_plan.md).

| [0015](0015-frontend-path-alias-cross-folder-imports.md) | Frontend cross-folder imports go through the `@/*` path alias, enforced by ESLint `import/no-relative-parent-imports` | Accepted | 7 (close-out, FE conventions refactor follow-up) |
| [0016](0016-agent-framework-foundry-iq-tas27-parity-review.md) | Agent Framework + Foundry IQ implementation review; TAS27 parity matrix and refactor path | Superseded by ADR-0017 | 8 prep (runtime parity audit) |

| [0021](0021-agent-framework-foundry-iq-kb-default.md) | `agent_framework` default + Foundry IQ Knowledge Base retrieval (`searchIndex` over `cwyd-index`; KB API version env-pinned) | Accepted (amended in part by [ADR-0025](0025-foundry-prompt-agent-ga-pattern.md)) | 8 |
| [0022](0022-config-resolution-error-on-incompatible-overrides.md) | Incompatible effective-config overrides raise a reusable `ConfigResolutionError` (HTTP 409 + ERROR telemetry); pgvector + `agent_framework` is the first guarded case | Accepted | 8 |
| [0023](0023-per-tenant-runtime-config-keying.md) | Per-tenant `RuntimeConfig` storage keying — tenant as a storage key (`id=runtime::{tenant}` in the Cosmos `_system` partition; `tenant_id` PK in Postgres); per-request resolution replaces the global `app.state` preload (amends `#35e(a)`) | Superseded by ADR-0024 | 5 (`#35g` per-tenant overrides) |
| [0024](0024-withdraw-per-tenant-runtime-config-single-tenant.md) | Withdraw per-tenant `RuntimeConfig` keying — the single-tenant deployment makes it a no-op over the singleton; `#35g` out of scope, tenant-claim seam removed; supersedes ADR 0023 | Accepted | 5 (`#35g` scope correction) |

| [0026](0026-shared-citation-format-contract.md) | Shared citation-format contract — R1 single shared grounding prompt, R2 single response-format point (`citations.py`), R3 backend-agnostic formatting with retrieval keyed by storage; `agent_framework` + pgvector stays rejected (ADR 0022) rather than given a divergent formatter | Accepted | 8 (agent runtime — citation parity; `BUG-0030`) |
| [0027](0027-agent-framework-app-side-rag-on-pgvector.md) | `agent_framework` grounds app-side on pgvector (`BaseSearch.search` + app-side citations); supersedes the ADR 0022 pgvector + `agent_framework` rejection block | Accepted | 8 (agent runtime — both orchestrators on pgvector; `BUG-0066`/`BUG-0067`) |
| [0028](0028-event-grid-single-trigger-blob-ingestion.md) | Event Grid is the single trigger for blob ingestion — a `blob_event` queue-trigger translator turns `BlobCreated` into a CWYD `doc-processing` envelope; makes the deployed system topic work | Accepted | 6 (Functions / RAG indexing; `BUG-0054`) |
