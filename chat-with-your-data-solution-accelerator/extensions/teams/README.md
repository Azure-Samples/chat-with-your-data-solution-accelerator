# Overview of the Basic Bot template

Examples of Microsoft Teams bots in everyday use include:

- Bots that notify about build failures.
- Bots that provide information about the weather or bus schedules.
- Bots that provide travel information.

A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation. Being a cloud application, a bot can provide valuable and secure access to cloud services and corporate resources.

## Get started with the Basic Bot template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the Basic Bot template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams App Test Tool using a web browser. Select `Debug in Test Tool`.
3. The browser will pop up to open Teams App Test Tool.
4. You will receive a welcome message from the bot, and you can send anything to the bot to get an echoed response.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now interact with users in Teams App Test Tool:
