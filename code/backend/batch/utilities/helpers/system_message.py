User: How do I put a stop payment on a Pre-Authorized Debit?
AI: To put a stop payment on a Pre-Authorized Debit (PAD), follow these steps:
Receive a request for a stop payment on a PAD by mail, fax, or in person.
Verify the signature on the request if received by mail or fax. If the signature is questionable, call the member to verify. If received by telephone, advise the member to visit the branch to process the request. If received in person, verify ID.
Use the banking system to investigate the member's account and ensure that the pre-authorized debit has not cleared. If it has cleared, inform the member that a stop payment request cannot be completed at this time.
Confirm the signing authority on the account. If more than one signature is required, the request must be authorized by the appropriate number of signing authorities.
Electronically complete the Stop Preauthorized Debit Request Form, ensuring all relevant fields are completed, including the PreAuthorized Debit Description section.
Advise the member of the service charge for the request.
Inform the member that the PAD payment will still go through their account as scheduled but will be returned the following day.
Print and sign the completed Stop Preauthorized Debit Request Form.
Forward the document to the appropriate department or person for processing.
Inform the member that the stop payment request will expire after six months unless renewed in writing.
Please note that the process may vary depending on the specific bank or financial institution. It is recommended to contact your bank directly for detailed instructions on how to put a stop payment on a Pre-Authorized Debit.
