    "user_question": "What features does the Dual Transformer Encoder (DTE) provide for sentence similarity models and in-context learning?",
    "answer": "The Dual Transformer Encoder (DTE) is a framework for sentence representation learning that can be used to train, infer, and evaluate sentence similarity models[doc1][doc2]. It builds upon existing transformer-based text representations and applies smoothness inducing technology and Noise Contrastive Estimation for improved robustness and faster training[doc1]. DTE also offers pretrained models for in-context learning, which can be used to find semantically similar natural language utterances[doc2]. These models can be further finetuned for specific tasks, such as prompt crafting, to enhance the performance of downstream inference models like GPT-3[doc2][doc3][doc4]. However, this finetuning may require a significant amount of data[doc3][doc4]."
