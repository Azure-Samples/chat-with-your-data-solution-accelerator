# 🚀 Major Refactor: Unified Threat Intel Agent Architecture, Dynamic Loading, and Enhanced Reporting

This commit delivers a sweeping architectural overhaul, enabling scalable, maintainable, and easily extensible security automation with a clear separation of concerns between agent logic, configuration, and orchestration.  
This makes it even easier for the AutoGen Agent Framework to leverage, and **more portable and reusable by anyone who wants to run these tools standalone**.

## 🧰 Standardized Security Tools Overview
| Tool Module (pythontools)        | Purpose / Description |
| ---                               | ---                   |
| `tool_threatintel_dns.py`         | DNS enrichment and resolution for assets and infrastructure |

> **Note:**
> - All tools are implemented as `FunctionTool` objects for agent compatibility.
> - Each tool has an associated test in `tests\test_tool_threatintel_{toolname}.py`.
